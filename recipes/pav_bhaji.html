        <li>Butter.</li>
        <li>Pav Bhaji Masala.</li>
        <li>Pav (Dinner Rolls)</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Rinse, peel and chop the veggies. You will need 1 cup chopped cauliflower, 1 cup chopped carrot, 3 medium sized potatoes (chopped) and ⅓ cup chopped french beans. </li>
            <li> Add all the above chopped veggies in a 3 litre pressure cooker. Also add 1 cup green peas (fresh or frozen). </li>
            <li> Add 2.25 to 2.5 cups water.</li>
            <li>Pressure cook the veggies for 5 to 6 whistles or for about 12 minutes on medium heat. </li>
            <li>When the pressure settles down on its own, open the cooker and check if the veggies are fork tender, softened and cooked well.  </li>
            <li>  Heat a frying pan or kadai (wok). You can also use a large tawa or a skillet. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons butter. You can use amul butter or any brand of butter. The butter can be salted or unsalted.</li>
            <li>  Let the butter melt.</li>
            <li>  As soon as the butter melts, add 1 teaspoon cumin seeds.</li>
            <li> Let the cumin seeds crackle and change their color.</li>
            <li>Then add ½ cup chopped onions. </li>
            <li>Mix onions with the butter and sauté on a low to medium heat. </li>
            <li> Sauté until the onions turn translucent.</li>
            <li> Add 2 teaspoons ginger-garlic paste. You can crush 1.5 inch ginger and 5 to 6 medium garlic cloves, in a mortar-pestle.</li>
            <li> Mix and sauté for some seconds until the raw aroma of both ginger and garlic goes away.</li>
            <li>  Then add 1 to 2 green chilies (chopped).</li>
            <li> Mix well.</li>

            <li>Add 2 cups finely chopped tomatoes. Swap canned tomatoes if you do not have fresh tomatoes.  </li>
            <li> Mix very well.</li>
            <li> Then begin to sauté tomatoes on a low to medium heat.</li>
            <li> Sauté until the tomatoes become soft, mushy and you see butter releasing from the sides. This takes about 6 to 7 minutes on a low to medium heat. </li>
            <li> When the tomatoes have softened, add ½ cup finely chopped capsicum (green bell pepper). Sauté for 2 to 3 minutes. </li>
            <li>  Add 1 teaspoon turmeric powder and 1 teaspoon Kashmiri red chilli powder.</li>
            <li> Add 2 to 3 tablespoons Pav bhaji Masala Powder. Depending on how instense is the aroma and flavor of pav bhaji masala, you can add it in less or more proportions. </li>
            <li> Mix very well.</li>
            <li> Add the cooked veggies. You can choose to mash the veggies before you add them in the pan or skillet. </li>
            <li> Mix well.</li>

            <li> Add all of the stock or water from the pressure cooker in which the veggies were cooked.</li>
            <li>Combine and mix thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Season with salt according to your taste preferences and give a mix. </li>


            <li>With a potato masher, begin to carefully mash the veggies directly in the pan.</li>
            <li> Keep on stirring occasionally and let the mashed vegetable gravy simmer for 8 to 10 minutes on a low heat.</li>
